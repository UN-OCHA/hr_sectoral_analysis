<b>It is encouraged to provide an analysis that relates to the measured indicators</b> (explain what the indicator is measuring, limitations of the measurement, if it is a proxy etc). <b>Should that prove to be too difficult it is encouraged to provide a more generic analysis along following aspects</b> (these categories are based on the MIRA analytical framework):

<ul>
<li><b>Drivers of the crisis and underlying factors</b> (natural hazard, socio-political, environmental, climatic, economic factors etc)</li>
<li><b>Scope of the crisis</b> (which areas are affected, how many people are affected, most affected groups, gender)</li>
<li><b>Status of the population</b> (mortality, morbidity, dignity/quality of life, how is protection affected, impact on livelihoods, access to goods and services)</li>
<li><b>National Capacity and Response</b> (what are the know coping mechanisms of affected communities, what are the existing national response capacities, how are they affected by the crisis, how many people are they targeting)</li>
<li><b>In-country international capacity and response:</b> What is the international response capacity within the country, are there any preparedness measure in place, which agencies are operational, what interventions are already taking place.</li>
</ul>
